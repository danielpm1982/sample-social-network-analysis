[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is a Jupyter Notebook series collection about Social Network Analysis (SNA) using Python, Pandas, NumPy, IGraph, and other SNA specific libs, along with Anaconda managed environments.

[**Content**]<br>
GitHub jupyter notebook | Colab dynamic code import and run:

1 - Basic SNA manipulation with IGraph - creating and getting statistics from a simple 5-order Graph <br>
GitHub:<br>
https://github.com/danielpm1982/sample-social-network-analysis/blob/master/base-sna-statistics.ipynb <br>
Colab:<br>
https://colab.research.google.com/github/danielpm1982/sample-social-network-analysis/blob/master/base-sna-statistics(colab-version).ipynb <br>

2 - Advanced SNA manipulation with IGraph using a real-world Dataset - creating a Graph based on .csv files; getting general (whole) network statistics; classifying the network into Communities and getting intra-community stats, while comparing these with extra-community (whole-network) ones <br>
GitHub:<br>
https://github.com/danielpm1982/sample-social-network-analysis/blob/master/karate-sna-statistics.ipynb <br>
Colab:<br>
https://colab.research.google.com/github/danielpm1982/sample-social-network-analysis/blob/master/karate-sna-statistics(colab-version).ipynb <br>

3 - Gephi zipped file, with the same project data from item 2 above and some analysis already done, including Communities classification with different resolutions and modularities, for being opened at Gephi opensource app and have checked out what can be done with this GUI SNA app, rather than with Python or its IGraph lib. Available at this GitHub project root: https://github.com/danielpm1982/sample-social-network-analysis 

[**Source Code and Run**]<br>
Source code available at github.com, through the following link:<br>
[https://github.com/danielpm1982/sample-social-network-analysis](https://github.com/danielpm1982/sample-social-network-analysis) <br>
The source code includes the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb files themselves, one for each subproject, as well as the environment.yml file, which can be used to generate an Anaconda environment for running this project (and subprojects) locally (don't forget to customize the env paths to your own filesystem and OS when creating the environment).<br>
You can also run this Jupiter Notebook project remotely at [https://colab.research.google.com/notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook), importing the content directly from this github repository to your Colab account, without having to create any Anaconda environment locally.<br>
